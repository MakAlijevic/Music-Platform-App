# SoundWave

SoundWave is a full-stack music platform web application developed in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, PHP with micro framework FlightPHP and MySQL database.

This is a project created during the Web Programming course at International Burch University.
The project is done the two dedicated and hard-working students Mak AlijeviÄ‡ and Emina Sirbubalo.

Our mutual passion for music gave rise to the idea for the music platform SoundWave. We decided to create and design our project based on the latest application trends, but also to implement our own twist to it. We truly hope that you will enjoy our application and have a ton of fun, and that you will provide us with feedback about your experience.
